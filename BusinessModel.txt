Business Model for Atlantic Styles

1. Niche Positioning & Brand Identity

- Theme: Emotion-driven fashion with a modern, global edge (e.g., “Where Style Meets Passion”).

- Design Focus: Unique, AI-generated statement pieces that tell a story — not just random graphics.

- Target Audience: Gen Z & Millennials (16–35), urban, expressive, into minimalist or bold identity-driven fashion.

2. Product Strategy

- Flagship Products:

  -> Premium unisex T-shirts (multiple sizes, vibrant colorways)

  -> Hoodie collection for fall/winter

- Design Themes (rotate monthly):

  -> Motivational typography

  -> Streetwear-style drops

  -> Art-driven minimal linework

  -> Local pride/culture tees (for micro-niches)

- Limited Drops to create urgency (e.g., “Drop 01: Ocean Pulse”)

🌍 3. Fulfillment & Inventory (Powered by Gelato)

- Use Ideogram AI to generate 10–15 unique designs/month.

- Upload them to Gelato’s product builder, apply across:

    -> Men’s & Women’s tees

    -> Hoodies

    -> Long-sleeves (seasonal)

- Offer worldwide shipping (Gelato handles fulfillment regionally to reduce shipping time and cost).

4. Pricing & Profit Margins

5. Marketing & Sales Strategy

a. Social Media Strategy
  
  - Instagram + TikTok: Short videos of designs being worn, AI design timelapses, creator messages

  - Pinterest: Mood boards, style inspiration using your designs

  - Facebook Ads: Target by interests (e.g., fashion, streetwear, ethical fashion, minimalist lifestyle)

b. Influencer & Micro-Collabs

  - Send free products to 10–15 micro-influencers (2K–10K followers) in exchange for photos/videos.

7. Scaling Strategy

- Launch a pre-order model for high-interest designs to test market before printing

- Consider bundling (Buy 2, get 1 50% off) once traffic increases

- Launch a “Design Collab Series” with artists or customers using Ideogram prompts

8. Long-Term Profit Levers
