Great move using ColorZilla — that's one of the best tools for grabbing accurate HEX codes directly from any web page (like Gelato’s product previews).

Now for your issue: when Gelato warns that your image is low resolution, it’s saying the file doesn't meet their minimum DPI (dots per inch) or pixel dimension requirements 
for high-quality printing on apparel. The good news is:

You Can Upscale PNG or JPG Images (Free, High Quality)

Here are the best free online tools to upscale your images without destroying quality, using AI-powered upscaling:

 1. Upscale Media — Best Overall (Free, No Signup): www.upscale.media

- Drag and drop your PNG or JPG

- Automatically enhances and upscales (2x to 4x)

- Preserves transparency in PNGs (important for logos!)

- No watermarks

Very good color and edge preservation

Great for: T-shirt logo files, vector-style designs, transparent artwork

2. Let’s Enhance — High-Quality Prints (Free Credits Available)

- Specifically built for print-ready designs

- Smart AI detects image type and adjusts accordingly

- You get free credits (usually 5–10 images per month on free plan)

- Can set output to 300 DPI (great for Gelato standards)

Great for: Complex designs, detailed illustrations, product photos

3. PIXLR’s Upscale Tool

- From the same creators as Pixlr E

- Drag, drop, enhance — super fast

- Free tier supports 2x upscale

- Good for logo and design images

4. Image Upscaler (https://imageupscaler.com)

- No signup needed

- Supports 2x and 4x enlargement

- Works well for clean PNG/JPG designs (but avoid photo-heavy ones here)

What to Avoid:

- Don’t use regular resizing tools like Paint or most phone apps — they’ll just stretch pixels, not enhance resolution.

- Stick to AI upscalers built for this purpose.

Ideal Size for Gelato:

- Aim for at least 4500 x 5400 pixels, PNG, and 300 DPI for best results.

- Especially important for large prints like full-front shirt designs.
