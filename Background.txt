Great question — if you're looking for a free online tool that can:

1. Automatically detect and remove the background, and

2. Replace it with any custom color (e.g. HEX color),

then the best option right now is:

Remove.bg + Pixlr (Combo Method — Accurate + Free)

Step 1: Use Remove.bg

- Automatically removes the background from any image.

- Extremely accurate for logos, designs, and even photos.

- Output is a transparent PNG.

Why use Remove.bg?

- It’s faster and more precise than most in-browser tools like Photopea or Pixlr's auto options.

- No manual clicking or editing needed — drag, drop, download.

Step 2: Use Pixlr E

To replace the transparent background with your custom color:

- Open your Remove.bg transparent PNG in Pixlr E.

- Add a new layer (Layer > Add Empty Layer).

- Drag it below your image layer.

- Select the Fill Tool (paint bucket) from the sidebar.

- Set your desired HEX color (e.g. #F1F1F1).

- Click on the new layer to apply the color as your new background.

- Export as PNG or JPG — your image now has the custom background color you chose.

Bonus: All-in-One Option (No Separate Site)

Fotor Background Remover

- It removes the background and lets you replace it with any solid color directly.

- Free tier available (limited resolution unless signed in).

- Less flexible than Pixlr but great for fast edits.

 Final Recommendation:

- For best quality and control, use Remove.bg + Pixlr.

- For one-click color background swap, use Fotor.
