Yes — this is a common issue when uploading designs to Gelato (or any Print-on-Demand platform) where the design background doesn't blend seamlessly with the shirt color, resulting 
in visible boxes or contrast blocks that ruin the aesthetic.

Here’s how to fix that professionally and consistently:

3 Ways to Match Design Background with Shirt Color on Gelato:

 1. Use Transparent Backgrounds for Your Designs (Best Practice)

- Always remove the background of your design (make it transparent) before uploading to Gelato.

- File format must be PNG with transparency enabled.

- This way, the design will float naturally over any shirt color you choose.

Tools to do this:

- Pixlr: Use the Eraser tool and export as PNG.

- Remove.bg: Upload your design and download the background-removed version.

- Photopea: Unlock the background layer > erase it > export as PNG with transparency.

2. Color Match the Design Background to the Shirt Color (If Transparency Isn't Possible)

If you must have a background in the design, do this:

Tools like:

- Pixlr, Photopea, Canva

- Use the color picker/eyedropper tool in Gelato or your editor to grab the exact shirt color hex code.

Steps:

- In your design editor, set the background color of the design to exactly match the Gelato shirt color (e.g., #F1F1F1 for light gray).

- Export the file as a high-res PNG or JPG.

- Upload it to Gelato — it will now blend perfectly.

Caution: If Gelato's color rendering changes slightly during printing, the match may not be 100% precise. Transparency is still safer.

3. Add a Soft Fade or Border

As a creative workaround:

- Add a soft gradient or feathered edge around your design to help it blend more smoothly with any shirt color.

- Works well with vintage or distressed aesthetics.

Pro Tip for Gelato:

- When previewing on Gelato, test your design on multiple shirt colors to ensure it blends well or the transparency works correctly.

- If using a solid color background, stick to white, black, or heather gray for easiest matching.
