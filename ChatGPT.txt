Ok awesome! Now I need to make some designs to use on t-shirts, and I need you to generate me 15 prompts that I need to be giving to ideogram to make it generate these designs for me. 
Please generate these prompts in a way so ideogram generates vibrant and bright designs which will attract sellers all around the globe and will make them buy the t-shirts from my store.

Plus its the last week of Jun e with July around the corner, so weathers here in North & South America, Europe and Asia are gonna be very hot. Can you also please generate the 15 prompts 
regarding the summer season, focusing maybe on ice-creams or sweet juicy fruits or other popular stuffs of summer and please include the key words like "vector", "centered composition", 
"no background", "vibrant colors", "neon", "high contrast", "colorful lighting" "bright", "bold palette" or words to make the designs stand out in the market.

Awesome!! Really nice prompts. Can you also please generate 15 summer prompts for ideogram regarding the theme "retro radio"?
